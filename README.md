# virtual_wallet
This university project aims to introduce us to web development using Java and Spring Boot.
The application simulates a virtual wallet, allowing users to register, create (fictional) accounts, and manage their funds through actions such as sending, depositing, and withdrawing money.

It also includes a points and rewards system, along with a detailed transaction history and a statistics section that displays user activity.
Additionally, a notification system is implemented using Twilio to send both text messages and emails.
